                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ever since I could remember, I had a passion for breaking things down and figuring out just how they work. 
                            While most kids were spending their weekends watching Saturday morning cartoons, 
                            I spent many days reverse engineering the code on websites and breaking apart my parent's computer to their horror.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                That passion and knowledge later sparked a big interest in both digital arts and Information technology. 
                                In high school and college, I studied everything from TV and film to website development and Digital Marketing. 
                                While I ultimately ended up pursuing a Radio/TV/Film degree with a minor focus towards computer science, 
                                I had my mind set on using the wonderful relationship of technology and online media marketing/distribution to my advantage.
                        </p>
                        <p id="exp">
                                While I currently work as a small time web analyst , I see my future in a much larger role within this industry helping guide major brands I really believe in towards a brighter path (And higher traffic). 
                                Between building websites, branding companies, analyzing web based stats and trends; I just want people to be as passionate and excited about your brand as I am about building, tinkering and improving it!
